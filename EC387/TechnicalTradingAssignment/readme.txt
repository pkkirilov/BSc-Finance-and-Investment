Hi Rob,

The R file contains the strategy being implemented under the different sample periods and sample data.
If you need to install any of the packages used (quantstrat, TTR or IKTrading), I have grayed out the 
commands.
Below is the order of the strategies:
1. In-Sample SPY testing period;
2. Out-of-sample SPY testing period;
3. In-sample SPY buy-and-hold;
4. Out-of-sample SPY buy-and-hold;
5. Out-of-sample AAPL testing period;
6. Out-of-sample AAPL buy-and-hold;
7. Out-of-sample QQQ testing period;
8. Out-of-sample QQQ buy-and-hold

Could you please run them one by one, as I have not changed the variable names.
Many thanks,
Petar
